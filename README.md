#‘Kickstarter’ Written Analysis

Overview of Project

	To break down a data set and provide Louise with a visual representation of successful theater projects; specifically plays.


Purpose

	The purpose of this project was to not only learn the basics of Excel but dive into a real-world application utilizing Excel as a tool for data analysis. With a solid foundation we were able to look at and expand upon different tools Excel has to offer, such as: functions, formatting, filtering, charts and tables.


Analysis and Challenges




• Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
	
1. This Pivot table showed that June to July presented the highest probability of launching a successful theater campaign. 

2. More campaigns failed in the second Quarter

• Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


	


• Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
o Writing VLOOK functions. I kept encountering errors after referencing the previous sheet
o Countifs Funtion
• =COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$E:$E,"<1000",Kickstarter!$H:$H,"US",Kickstarter!$T:$T,"rock") 
o This function wouldn’t pull in the data 

Results


- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	n/a



- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	The data set presents a data that covers a wide range of projects that don’t pertain to Louise’s needs. So this data set can probably present skewed data

	

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	
	We could use a pie chart to display the quarters with the greatest success rates.
